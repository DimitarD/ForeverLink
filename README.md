# ForeverLink
 
ForeverLink is a React component that can be used as a substitute to the a (anchor) HTML element. The main difference is that ForeverLink keeps the link fresh, even if the website linked to is down, by utilizing the Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) and using the latest cached version of the site. Additionally, there is an option to display a custom message if a link is not valid at all.
